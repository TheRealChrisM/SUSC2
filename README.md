# SUSC2: Scaleable Uninterruptible System for Command and Control

This project aims to create a Command and Control (C2) system that is resistant to network-level blocking and control server takedowns. It accomplishes this via a distributed system of control nodes that relies on pull-based activity (i.e., victims polling control nodes, control nodes polling other control nodes) in order to transfer data.

## How to Use

We don't know yet, but we'll get there soon.
